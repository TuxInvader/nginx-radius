:toc: left

== Introduction

This repo includes an NGINX Stream configuration for load balancing RADIUS

The Javascript file is NGINX NJS, which can inspect RADIUS traffic and provide session persistence for Access-Challenges during authentication, you can also use it to add additional Attribute pairs to the RADIUS packets, and update the Message-Authenticator when you do so.
